<h3>Why do we need a new programming language ? </h3>

 Existing programming languages had some problems , some of them had quite *fast* compile time but *complex* code structure whereas some had *easy* code structure but *slow* compile time .<br><br>
 <p align="center"> <i>The goals of the Go project were to eliminate the slowness and clumsiness of software development at Google, and thereby to make the process more productive and scalable. The language was designed by and for people who write and read and debug and maintain large software systems.</i>

 <h3> So , a new language was created with the aim of providing </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Faster compile times<img align="right" height="400px" width="700px" alt="compile-time" src="https://www.bluematador.com/hubfs/Blue_Matador_Inc_October2017/Images/golang-language-compilation-time.png" > <br><br>
  <li><a href="https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2019/11/11/The-Value-in-Gos-Simplicity/">Simplicity</a>  <br><br>
  <li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/std">Powerful Standard libraries</a><br><br>
  <li>Little or no memory management issues <br><br>
  <li><a href="https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote">Garbage collection</a><br><br>
  <li>Strong and structured code format
</ul>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<h2> Where is Go used ? </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use of Go in modern-day technologies and services etc is increasing at a fast pace due to unending benifits . It is used in 
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li> Various companies such as Uber , Twitch , Dropbox , Google and <i>many more...</i>
  <li> Distributed Network Services
  <li> Cloud-Native Development
  <li>Utilities and Stand-Alone Tools
  <li>Media Platforms & News Outlets  
    </ul> <br>
  <li>It is also used as/in replacement for Existing Infrastructure
 </ul>
 
 <br><br>
    
    
  <h2> Conclusion </h2>
  
  Conclusively , GoLang is a innovative effort focused on making development and operations faster , memory efficient and less complex . 
  <br> It has proved itself to be better than other languages in terms of speed , reliability and portability making it one of the first choices of developers.
