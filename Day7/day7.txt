-------------------------------DAY7---------------------------
In the day 7 i have started ti follow the prerequisite and finish the last one in that prerequisite 

that is "yaml"  

-I have watched the "Intro to Yaml file " with tech with nana

-It was so simple and so exciting that it is too different from the xml and json file

-yet an another markup lanuage or yaml ain't markup language 

-the intendations plays an very important role in creating yaml file 

-It is created as it should be user readable alone no strings attached 

-no coding like thing no semocolon no open braces nothing

-only thing that we should care about is that intendations 

-on online there are many resources forclearing the intendations erros so using yaml is so useful

-we also able to create list like something 

-as i have finished my pre requisite and today is sunday so i will be documenting and putting everything together 
on every sunday im gonna do this for my future reference
