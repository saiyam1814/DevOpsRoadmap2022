# ABOUT
Hi, my name is Mussa Khan Shaukat.I am currently pursuing my Computer Science Degree. I'm currently enrolled in my final year. In my last remote job, I worked as backend/support engineer for a company which were mostly involved in providing the cloud services to the clients, which kinda make me curious to lean and learn the Cloud Native World. 

Currently, I'm full time pursuing my studies and focusing to learn and DevOps landscape. During this whole time, I'm going to share my personal experience while learning new things everyday.
