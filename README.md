# Want to learn DevOps the right way in 2022 ? You have come to the right place

I have created the complete DevOps roadmap that anyone can follow and be job ready in 6 months. You can download the [roadmap pdf](https://github.com/saiyam1814/devopsroadmap2022/blob/main/DevOps%20roadmap%202022.pdf), take print out and get started. 

The [complete video](https://youtu.be/7l_n97Mt0ko) is on my [YouTube channel](https://saiyampathak.com/youtube), do not forget to share it with your friends.

Learning in public is very important so you can create PR's to this repo by:
- cloning the repo.
- create {YourName} folder.
- In that folder you create folder for each day.
- Add in detail what you have learnt so that others can be motivated as well. 

Few good examples :
