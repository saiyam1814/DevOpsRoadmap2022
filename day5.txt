--------------------------------------day5-----------------------------------------------


In the Devops roadmap on the day5 i have started learning about Go language 


I have choosen the video from tech with nana and W3 tutorials for reference 


I have learnt why go was introduced and what it can solve and how to learn it 


Go was developed by google in order to solve the issues in the part of infrastructure as a code 
and also wants to solve the issue of multi threading and to implement multi thread in a easy way 


It also has the speed compared to C++ and also the low code like the python

It has also has similar changed like using fmt into it and no use of : or;needed at the end of the line 

It has also made the compiler to assume many more important things which is not specified 
 such as  not telloing the type of var standard use of "var" word

As of now Im enjoying the learning process
